Demo recording suggestion:
1. Start with a 5-8 second intro speaking to camera (use script from chat):
   "Hi Daniella, I'm Bhavethra. Here's a quick demo of a small tool I built..."
2. Switch to screen-share of the app running (http://localhost:3000 or Vercel URL).
3. Paste a short diff or description (example provided below), click generate, show result.
4. Finish with 3-4s closing line: "Happy to share the repo and expand this feature."

Example diff/description to paste:
- "Refactor user service: rename getUser to fetchUser, remove unused param, and add cache layer"
- Expected output: "refactor(user-service): rename getUser to fetchUser and add caching"
